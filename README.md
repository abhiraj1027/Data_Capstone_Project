# 🌍 Global Country Data Analysis Project [CAPSTONE PROJECT]

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of countries around the world based on a wide range of socio-political, demographic, economic, and geographic indicators. Using Python and powerful data analysis libraries, the dataset is cleaned, filtered, and explored to uncover meaningful global and regional insights.

---

## 📌 Overview

The dataset includes rich information on:
- Country details (name, currency, capital, region, etc.)
- Geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude)
- Land use (agricultural land, etc.)
- Population statistics (urban, rural, total)
- Women’s representation in parliament
- Press freedom and democracy indicators
- Political leader and system information
- Median age and developmental indicators

The project demonstrates how to filter and analyze this data by continent, region, and regime type to answer key questions about global trends and governance.
